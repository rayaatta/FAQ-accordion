## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I got to use the details element...never used it before..I kid you not
if they have the same name they cant be open at the same time.
If you want one to be open by default ,add open inside the tag

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<details name="faqs" open>
        <summary> <span></span></summary>
        <p>
        </p>
</details>
<details name="faqs" >
        <summary> <span></span></summary>
        <p>
        </p>
</details>

      
```
